## Project Description
<!-- you can include known bugs, design decisions, external references used... -->
In this project, I made a chatroom application where users can create chatrooms, and join existing chatrooms. Users are free to message other people in the chatroom. For the backend I am using MongoDB.
## Ethics Questions

### Question 1

> Give two possible chatroom moderation features and the reasons that you should implement each one

1. I would add a profanity filter, blocking inappropriate words/phrases. This is to keep the chat PG and family friendly.
2. Secondly, I would add unique roles. Perhaps a moderator role with permissions to watch the chat. An example perm would the ability to kick a person from the chat.
