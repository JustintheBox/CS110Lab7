### Question 1

> Give two possible chatroom moderation features and the reasons that you should implement each one

1. I would add a profanity filter, blocking inappropriate words/phrases. This is to keep the chat PG and family friendly.
2. Secondly, I would add unique roles. Perhaps a moderator role with permissions to watch the chat. An example perm would the ability to kick a person from the chat.
